---WHAT THE FILES DO---
processSentMail.py: Takes a CSV file of emails, sets up lists of topical words, and counts and plots the frequency of those words' appearance in the emails.

processReceivedMail.py: Takes a CSV file of emails, looks for data information in each email, plots the distribution of emails through a time period. Also plots the day of the week the emails were received.

There are comments in each file with links to useful websites that we based code on.

---TO RUN---
You will need Python. For more information, see: https://www.pythoncentral.io/execute-python-script-file-shell/
